# pdf-chatbot-app

This project aims to create an app where users can manually load their custom pdfs and chat to it like ChatGPT. This is done via RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). Goal is to learn more about LLMs and RAG.

There will be several iterations of the project. Each time adding more functionalities and improvements, slowly moving towards a usable app. 

Note to self: Will need to think about the package dependecy if using Ollama will need to think of potentially using Docker and if create an app, might need to get a EC2 instance to host the app, storage, memory etc. 


# to do
* show loading... after upload
* stream output
* make it work for multiple pdfs upload
